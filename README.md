Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering: This is the process of writting a set of instrustion to the computer to perform various task like automation, data analysis and more. This set of instructions can also be buldled together to create what we called application software which combines different field of sofware engineering together like frontend which is the part the user of the software interact with, backend the part that takes care of all the user activities and the database where all the user datas are stared of easy access and retrevals.

Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry
Software engineering is very important in this present day technogy industry because the world is evolving at a very speedy rate and technology is the one major contributing factor of this evolution so there a need for highly skilled software engineer to as to be able to keep up with the evolution that is moving in a fast pace. Here are few out of many iportance of software engineering in the technology industry:

1. Innovtion: evolutions rely strongly on innovation hence the need for Software engieering is paramount in the technology because it birth new ideas which strongly impact and determine the future of the technology industry

2. Automation: Software engineering helps in developing software that automate repetitive activities for instead of us having to repeat some task which aids so many precess in the tachnology sectors.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming laguage (Fortran, C) 
2. Establishment of Software engineering as a discipline in 1960
3. The advent of structure programming in 1970 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement / Research: Knowing what it will take to executes the project in terms of Finance, Technology to be use, man power etc.
2. Design: After know the requirements, the product will be design based of the findings from the requirements / research. This stage include the product architecture, UI/UX etc
3. Implementation: The design will be implement using the programming language of choice. This stage include coding, testing etc
4. Testing: This is the stage where the product will be tested to ensure it meets the requirement
5. Deployment: This is the stage where the product will be deployed to the customer
6. Maintenance: This is the stage where the product will be maintained to ensure it continues to meet


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
